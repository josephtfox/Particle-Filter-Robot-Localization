'''
Class: Robot

Represents the robot in the simulation.

Attributes:
    position (tuple): The robot's current position (x, y).
    orientation (float): The robot's current orientation in radians.
    sensor_noise (float): Standard deviation of noise in sensor measurements.
    motion_noise (float): Standard deviation of noise in motion commands.
Methods:
    move(delta_distance, delta_angle): Updates the robot's position and orientation based on motion commands with added noise.
    sense(landmarks): Returns simulated distance measurements to each landmark with added noise.
