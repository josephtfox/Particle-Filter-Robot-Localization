'''
Class: ParticleFilter

Manages a collection of particles and implements the particle filter algorithm.

Attributes:
    particles (list): A list of Particle objects.
    num_particles (int): The number of particles in the filter.
Methods:
    initialize_particles(map_bounds): Initializes particles randomly within the map bounds.
    update(motion_command, measurement, landmarks): Updates all particles based on motion and measurement data.
    resample(): Resamples particles based on their weights to focus on more likely hypotheses.
    estimate_position(): Estimates the robot's position as a weighted average of all particles' positions.
